            The rate of APR you will be charged will be set by the moneylender.
            The figure can differ and, will be based both on the information
            that you provide to the lender within your loan request and the data
            the loan provider supplied to you. The lender will always notify you
            of the APR they can offer you.<br/><br/> APR rates are based on how
