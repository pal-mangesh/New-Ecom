            the lenders and financial service providers that advertise on this
            website. The operator of this website is neither a lender nor a
            broker and does not make any credit decisions. This website merely
            takes information from consumers and forwards it to lenders and
            third parties who may be able to provide the types of loans that may
            meet the consumers needs. For those consumers who do not qualify for
            a Personal Loan, we will refer you to alternative lenders and
            providers. This website shall not be considered an offer or
            solicitation for a loan. There is no guarantee that you will be
            approved for any type of loan. We do not charge you for the service
            we provide and are not a representative or agent of any lender or
            third party provider. We are compensated by lenders and third
            parties. The time it takes for money to transfer to your account
            will vary by lender and also depend on your individual financial
            institution. You may be required to fax information to your lender
            in order to receive a loan. This service and lenders are not
            available in all states. If you have any question regarding the
            details of your loan, you should contact your lender directly.
            Personal loans and other types of loans should not be considered a
            long term financial solution. They are means to provide short term
            financing to solve immediate financial needs. Lenders and third
            party providers may perform a credit check with one or more credit
            agencies. These credit checks can have an impact on your credit
            score. By submitting your request, you are authorizing the lenders
            and third party providers to independently verify the information
            you submitted and your credit worthiness. Nothing on this website
            shall constitute an offer or solicitation for a loan. Availability:
            Residents of some states in the U.S. may not qualify for a bad
            credit loan as a result of certain lender requirements. The Website
            does not guarantee that completing a loan request form will result
            in you being offered a loan product by a lender, or you being
            offered a product with rates or terms as desired.
